                            However, as paradigm of the political arena in the country shifted, Kabiru decamped to United Nigerian Peoples’ Party and contested for the seat of Kebbi State Governor in 2003. After the 2003 elections, he later decamped to PDP the same year and was the Party’s Kebbi State Gubernatorial Aspirant in 2007. Following series of betrayals and numerous controversies, Kabiru decided to Join ACN in 2011. This, however, did not last as he later returned to PDP the same year. In 2014/15, looking at his tremendous achievements and wealth of experience, Kabiru was appointed Deputy Director General (North) of PDP Presidential Campaign Organization.
